               <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
               <p>
                  Needs & Wishes cannot <u>ever</u> help persons with expenses that fall into one or more of the
                  following categories:
               </p>

               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Expenses we are not <u>permitted</u> by law to pay.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                     This would include federal, state, or local tax payments; child support, legal fees associated from
                     a criminal/civil
                     defense. (For example, we cannot pay your property tax, traffic tickets or lawyer’s fees)
                  </p>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Expenses that we <u>cannot</u> pay directly to the creditor or that could be returned as
                        cash back to an applicant.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                     Needs & Wishes' policies do not allow sending cash directly to an applicant. For example, we are
                     unable to pay for
                     groceries, rent to a family member, security deposits as these can be returned for cash to the
                     applicant.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                     <strong>Expenses related to credit card debt, bankruptcy, or luxury items.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <p>
                     Needs & Wishes believes in order to help the community the best way, our giving should be
                     responsible. Therefore we do
                     not help pay for credit card bills, vacation trips or bankruptcies, etc.
                  </p>
               </ul>

                        <p>
                           We value the support that the public provides for the mission of Needs & Wishes Foundation by visiting our
                           organization's website, giving what they are able, and telling others about it. So that we may better assist you, you
                           may be asked to list your name, address, and other information if you wish to participate in Needs & Wishes or apply
                           for
                           available financial aid. Our policy with regards to your personal information is listed below.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Information we collect about our Donors and Applicants</strong></p>
                        <p>Needs & Wishes asks persons who wish to interact with the Needs & Wishes website to register with the organization.
                           During the voluntary registration process, persons are required to provide their names, physical addresses, e-mail
                           addresses, and telephone numbers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Additionally, as a part of our application process, we may request that applicants provide us with a series of
                           documents
                           in support of their applications for assistance. These documents will vary from case to case but generally will
                           include,
                           at minimum, a copy of a state-issued photo ID, proof of income, proof of employment, proof of housing cost, or other
                           types of documentation as deemed necessary to verify the details of a particular application for assistance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Federal and state laws regarding the retention of documents by non-profit organizations require that we keep any
                           documentation submitted to us by an applicant during the application process for a period of six years.

                        The President and/or Board of Directors of Needs & Wishes Foundation will make all reasonable efforts to honor the
                        requests of donors to Needs & Wishes Foundation with respect to the use of their donations, subject to the guidelines of
                        the Internal Revenue Service and the state of Texas. However, neither the President nor the Board of Directors of Needs
                        & Wishes Foundation absolutely guarantees that they will be able to honor said requests.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Relationship of Giving to the Grant Making Process</strong></p>
                     <p>
                        Because Needs & Wishes is not a resource for the truly indigent, Needs & Wishes Foundation encourages and makes it
                        possible for all interested persons who visit Needs & Wishes' website or who otherwise learn of Needs & Wishes
                        Foundation to give to Needs & Wishes Foundation, including those persons who request assistance from Needs & Wishes.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Giving and receiving at Needs & Wishes are related only in as much as the organization is able to award more (and
                        occasionally larger) amounts of financial assistance as gifts to Needs & Wishes increase. However, the fact that an
                        applicant for financial assistance from Needs & Wishes Foundation has made a gift, financial, inkind, or otherwise to
                        the foundation does not entitle said applicant to any kind of special consideration in the grant making process and does
                        not guarantee that the applicant will receive any kind of financial assistance from Needs & Wishes. Persons inclined to
                        give to Needs & Wishes only because they believe that, in so doing, they will better their chances of receiving
                        financial assistance from Needs & Wishes Foundation should not give to Needs & Wishes Foundation.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Correspondence and Communication with Needs & Wishes Foundation</strong></p>
                     <p>Needs & Wishes Foundation receives a large number of letters, telephone calls, e-mail, and other types of
                     correspondence. The President and his duly appointed representatives attempt to respond to all such correspondence as
                     appropriate but cannot guarantee that they will be able to answer all such correspondence sent to Needs & Wishes
                     Foundation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     All correspondence sent to Needs & Wishes Foundation or any of its representatives by mail, fax, e-mail, electronic
                     transmission or by any other means becomes immediately and irrevocably the sole property of Needs & Wishes Foundation
                     and may be used for any purpose related to Needs & Wishes Foundation at the sole discretion of the President and/or
                     Board of Directors of Needs & Wishes Foundation without further notice or compensation.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>Additionally, Needs & Wishes Foundation requires that all communication with Needs & Wishes Foundation and Needs &
                     Wishes Foundation's staff - written, verbal, electronic and otherwise - be conducted in a reasonable and respectful
                     manner.</strong> Respectful communication allows us to best serve our applicants and ensures that all communication results in a
                     productive outcome for Needs & Wishes Foundation, the organization's staff members, and - most importantly - for our
                     applicants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Because we find that unreasonable and disrespectful communication does not foster results that align with the goals and
                     principles of Needs & Wishes Foundation, such communication will be deemed a violation of our Terms of Service and will
                     result in the immediate and permanent closure of the offending person's account with Needs & Wishes Foundation.

                  <p>
                     Needs & Wishes Foundation, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization under the laws of the State of Delaware,
                     encourages the solicitation and acceptance of gifts to Needs & Wishes Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the
                     "Foundation") for purposes that will help the Foundation to further and fulfill its mission. The following policies and
                     guidelines govern acceptance of gifts made to the Foundation or for the benefit of any of its programs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The Mission of Needs & Wishes Foundation is:

                     <ul>

                                                   To prevent otherwise financially self-sufficient individuals and families from entering the cycle of poverty, when this might be avoided with a small amount of well-timed financial assistance;
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                   To restore the financial self-sufficiency of individuals who are willing to work but are temporarily unable to do so
                                                   because they do not have the means to remit payment for a work-related expense;
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                   To empower permanently disadvantaged individuals who otherwise live within their limited means to continue to live
                                                   independently, despite a temporary, unexpected financial set-back; and
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                   To strengthen small non-profit organizations by providing a forum whereby such organizations can apply directly to the
                                                   general public for the help they need to complete the relatively inexpensive projects that will allow them to better
                                                   serve their clients and the communities they exist to serve.

                  <p><strong>I. Purpose of Policies and Guidelines</strong></p>
                  <p>
                     The Board of Directors of Foundation and its staff solicit current and deferred gifts from individuals, corporations,
                     and foundations to secure the future growth and missions of the Foundation. These policies and guidelines govern the
                     acceptance of gifts by the Foundation and provide guidance to prospective donors and their advisors when making gifts to
                     the Foundation. The provision of these policies shall apply to all gifts received by the Foundation for any of its
                     programs or services.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>II. Use of Legal Counsel</strong></p>
                  <p>
                     Foundation shall seek the advice of legal counsel in matters relating to acceptance of gifts when appropriate. Review by
                     counsel is recommended for:

                  <p><strong>III. Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
                  <p>
                     Needs & Wishes will urge all prospective donors to seek the assistance of personal legal and financial advisors in
                     matters relating to their gifts and the resulting tax and estate planning consequences. The Foundation will comply with
                     the <i>Modest Standards of Practice for the Charitable Gift Planner</i> promulgated by the National Committee on Planned
                     Giving.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>IV. Restrictions on Gifts</strong></p>
                  <p>
                     The Foundation will accept unrestricted gifts, and gifts for specific programs and purposes, provided that such gifts
                     are not inconsistent with its stated mission, purposes, and priorities. The Foundation will not accept gifts that are
                     too restrictive in purpose. Gifts that are too restrictive are those that violate the terms of the corporate charter,
                     gifts that are too difficult to administer, or gifts that are for purposes outside the mission of the Foundation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Additionally, donors to Needs & Wishes may not, under any circumstances, request that their contribution be restricted
                     to a specific individual named by the donor, or to a specific application for assistance visible on the Needs & Wishes
                     website. Needs & Wishes cannot accept contributions carrying either of these types of restrictions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     With regard to other types of restrictions, the Executive Team shall make all final decisions on the restrictive nature
                     of a gift, and its acceptance or refusal.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>V. Types of Gifts</strong></p>

                                       plans. Such designations will not be recorded as gifts to the Foundation until such time as the gift is irrevocable and
                                       the Foundation has knowledge of such designation. When the gift is irrevocable, but is not due until a future date, the
                                       present value of that gift may be recorded at the time the gift becomes irrevocable.</li>
                                       <li><strong>Life Insurance.</strong> Donors and supporters of the Foundation will be encouraged to name the Foundation as beneficiary or contingent
                                       beneficiary of their life insurance policies. Such designations shall not be recorded as gifts to the Foundation until
                                       such time as the gift is irrevocable and the Foundation has knowledge of such designation. Where the gift is
                                       irrevocable, but is not due until a future date, the present value of that gift may be recorded at the time the gift
                                       becomes irrevocable
                                       </li>
                                       <li><strong>Securities.
                                       </strong> The Foundation can accept both publicly traded securities and closely held securities.</li>
                                       <li>
                                          To be accepted, closely held securities must have a qualified appraisal performed by an independent professional
                                          appraiser generally as the expense of the Donor. If potential problems arise on initial review of the security, further
                                          review and recommendation by an outside professional may be sought before making a final decision on acceptance of the
                                          gift. Following advice by legal counsel, the Executive Team shall make the final determination on the acceptance of
                                          closely held securities. Every effort will be made to sell closely held securities as quickly as possible. If not
                                          immediately marketable, the stock will be kept in the safe deposit box until they can be redeemed.
                                       </li>
                                       <li><strong>Real Estate</strong> Gifts of real estate may include developed property, undeveloped property, or gifts subject to a prior life interest.
                                       The real estate being gifted must be titled to the donor(s). When appropriate, a title binder shall be obtained by the
                                       Foundation prior to the acceptance of the real property gift. The cost of this title binder shall generally be an
                                       expense of the donor. Prior to acceptance of real estate, donors are requested to advise the Foundation of any
                                       environmental issues that may be readily identified. The Foundation may require an initial environmental review of the
                                       property to ensure that the property has no environmental damage. Environmental inspection forms are attached as an
                                       appendix to this document. The Foundation’s Board of Directors may, at its own discretion, waive the environmental
                                       inspection requirement. In the event that the initial inspection reveals a potential problem, the Foundation shall
                                       retain a qualified inspection firm to conduct an environmental audit. The cost of the environmental audit shall
                                       generally be an expense of the donor, although the Foundation will consider such expense at the advice of the Executive
                                       Team. Prior to acceptance of the real property, the gift shall be approved by the Executive Team of the Foundation and
                                       by the Foundation’s Legal Counsel. The Board of Directors, at its discretion, may refuse any gift of real estate.
                                       Criteria for acceptance of the property shall include:
                                       </li>
                                       <ul>

                                          <li>Are there any restrictions, reservations, easements, or other limitations associated with the property?</li>
                                          <li>Are there carrying costs, which may include insurance, property taxes, mortgages, or notes, etc., associated with the
                                          property?</li>
                                          <li>Does the environmental audit, if required, reflect that the property is not damaged?</li>
                                       </ul>
                                       <li><strong>Tangible Personal Property.</strong> All other gifts of tangible personal property shall be examined in

                                             Are there any undue restrictions on the use, display, or sale of the property?
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                             Are there any carrying costs for the property?

                                          <li>
                                             Can the property be sold easily?
                                          </li>
                                          <li>
                                             Are there costs associated with transportation, storage, selling, maintenance and repair for the property?
                                          </li>

                                             The Executive Team will make the final determination on the acceptance of other tangible property gifts.
